            <h3>Waste Segregation means dividing trash/waste into bidegradable,non-biodegradable,recyclable</h3>
            
            <br><p>When we segregate waste, there is reduction of waste that gets landfilled and occupies space, air and water pollution rates are considerably lowered. Segregating waste also makes it easier to apply different processes - composting, recycling and incineration can be applied to different kinds of waste</p>

            <h3>1) 5 SIMPLE WAYS TO PRACTISE WASTE SEGREGATION.</h3>
            <p>Here are some steps to manage and segregate waste:<br>

<br>1. Keep separate containers for dry and wet waste in the kitchen.<br>

<br>2. Keep two bags for dry waste collection- paper and plastic, for the rest of the household waste<br>

<br>3. Keep plastic from the kitchen clean and dry and drop into the dry waste bin. Keep glass/plastic containers rinsed of food matter.<br>

<br>4. Send wet waste out of your home daily. Store and send dry waste out of the home, once a week.<br>

<br>5. Keep a paper bag for throwing the sanitary waste</p><br>
            <h3>2)What is Waste Segregation.</h3><br>
            <p>Segregation of our waste is essential as the amount of waste being generated today caused immense problem. There are certain items are not Bio Degradable but can be reused or recycled in fact it is believed that a larger portion of the waste can be recycled, a part of can be converted to compost, and only a smaller portion of it is real waste that has no use and has to be discarded.</p><br>
            <h3>3)Why should I segregate my waste properly? </h3><br>
            <p>The first reason is it is legally required.  Under the Waste Regulations 2011, you must segregate paper, cardboard, plastic, metal and glass at source unless it is technically or economically unfeasible.  Under the same regulations, you should implement the waste hierarchy; reduce, reuse, recycle, other recovery and disposal.  By law, you should implement this hierarchy and segregation helps with recycling in particular</p>
